- We should consider introducing a descriptive DSL to describe a board
and orchestrate components together to make a functional board. Less
code is better.

- We have implemented QEMU checker to abort or exit a test, however
it's not enough for validating functionalities. We might introduce
`FileCheck` to validate output of tests.

- Build PIC toolchains, so that we can build static PIE with dynamic relocation
  entries.

- Stablize ELF module loader.

- Support dynamic kernel modules.

- Extend kernel via WASM.

- Add process model.
