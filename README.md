# vivo BlueOS Kernel
vivo BlueOS kernel is developed using the Rust programming language, featuring security, lightweight, and generality. It is compatible with POSIX interfaces and supports Rust std.

## Technical Architecture
For details, please visit the vivo BlueOS official website [kernel](https://blueos.vivo.com/kernel) page.

## Board Support
- vivo BlueOS kernel currently supports arm32, arm64, and riscv chip architectures, along with corresponding qemu platforms
- Support for additional development boards is currently in progress

# vivo BlueOS Kernel Toolchain
We have forked the upstream Rust compiler to support vivo BlueOS kernel targeted to `*-vivo-blueos-*` and vivo BlueOS's Rust std.

We'll finally contribute our changes to the upstream repository and make `*-vivo-blueos-*` a supported platform of Rust.

## How to build
Please check [Build Kernel Rust Toolchain](https://github.com/vivoblueos/book/blob/main/src/build-rust-toolchain.md).
